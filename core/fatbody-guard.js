 * VECTFOX — FATBODY DnD FRAMEWORK GUARD
 * ============================================================================
 * Keeps VectFox's semantic lorebook activation away from lorebooks owned by the
 * Fatbody DnD Framework extension.
 *
 * Fatbody's "Lore Router" stores D&D stat / world-state tracking AS world-info
 * (lorebook) entries, in "campaign books" namespaced by a prefix derived from the
 * chat id, and it deliberately deactivates entries to manage its token budget. If
 * VectFox were to vectorize and semantically re-surface those entries, it would
 * fight Fatbody's controlled activation and corrupt stat tracking.
 *
 * This module mirrors Fatbody's own ownership rule so VectFox can recognise — and
 * leave alone — books that belong to Fatbody. It reads Fatbody's live campaign
 * prefix through the global Fatbody publishes (`globalThis._rpgGetCurrentPrefix`),
 * so there is NO hard dependency: when Fatbody is not installed the prefix resolves
 * to '' and every check below is a no-op.
 * ============================================================================

 * changes on chat switch, and the guard runs in the per-generation retrieval path.
